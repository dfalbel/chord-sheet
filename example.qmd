## She came in through the bathroom window

```{.chord format="chordsheet"}
A                                   D
 She came in through the bathroom window
A          F#m             D
 Protected by a silver spoon
A            F#m                       D
 But now she sucks her thumb and wonders
        D7                    A
By the banks of her own lagoon

                Dm      A
Didn't anybody tell her?
                Dm
Didn't anybody see?
  G7                         C
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
  G7                      C   A
Tuesday's on the phone to me

                               D
She said she'd always been a dancer
A                F#m            D
She worked in fifteen clubs a day
A                F#m                   D
And though she thought I knew the answer
         D7                     A
Well, I knew but I could not say

                             D       A
And so I quit the police department
         F#m             D    A
And got myself a steady job
               F#m                   D
And though she tried her best to help me
      D7                         A
She could steal but she could not rob

                Dm      A
Didn't anybody tell her?
                Dm
Didn't anybody see?
  G7                         C
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
  G7                      C      A
Tuesday's on the phone to me oh yeah
